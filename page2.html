The graphs also reveal the usage distribution of different social media platforms within the dataset. The most popular platform in the dataset is Facebook, with over half of the individuals (57.3%) using it. Tiktok and Instagram are also quite popular, with 17% and 14% usage respectively. The other platforms have lower usage rates, with some representing less than 1% of the dataset.</p>

                            <p>Both histograms are skewed to the right, also known as positively skewed or right-skewed. This is a representation of a dataset where the distribution of values is asymmetrical. In this type of histogram, the bars on the left side are taller than the bars on the right side, this indicates that there are fewer data points with high values compared to lower values. </p>

This means that the "age" table has more outliers than the "hours using social media per day" table.

                            <p>In the “hours using social media per day” box and whisker plot, the median falls to the right of the center of the box. This means that the distribution is negatively skewed or skewed to the left. The whiskers are also about the same length, meaning the distribution is approximately symmetric. The interquartile range is the range between the first and third quartile. The interquartile range in this plot is the box, which measures from 3 to 6 hours. The measure of the interquartile range interprets how spread the middle values are, since it measures from 3 to 6, the middle values are spread higher than the middle values of the "age" plot. The outliers, extreme values that differ from most points in the dataset, in the plot are the points outside the fences. In the plot, the fences are represented by the whiskers. Therefore any points outside the whiskers are outliers.</p>

The whiskers are also the same length, meaning the distribution is symmetric. The interquartile range is the range between the first and third quartile. The interquartile range in this plot is the box, which measures 15 years to 15 years. The measure of the interquartile range interprets how spread the middle values are, since it measures from 15 to 15, the middle values are spread lower than the middle values of the "hours using social media per day" plot. The outliers, extreme values that differ from most points in the dataset, in the plot are the points outside the fences. In the plot, the fences are represented by the whiskers. Therefore any points outside the whiskers are outliers. Also note that the median, the first and third quartile, and the lower and upper fence are all the same value, which is 15. This means that the box and whiskers all fall into the 15 line.</p>

            <p>The primary aim of this project was to examine how certain age groups use social media on a regular basis. Its key purpose was to pinpoint the social media platforms that individuals within these age groups are inclined to utilize. The data collected can provide useful information on how to create effective engagement tactics for distinct age groups on social media networks. Based on the finds of the study, the following conclusions are drawn:
                <ol>
                    <li>The social media site that is most popular between people of different age groups is Facebook.</li>
                    <li> The age group that utilizes social media platforms to the greatest extent is individuals aged between 9.5 and 17.5 years old.</li>
                    <li>According to the research findings, the typical usage duration of social media among people across various age brackets is within the range of 0.5 to 3.5 hours. </li>
                </ol>
